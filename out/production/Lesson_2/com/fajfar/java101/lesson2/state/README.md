# Definition

An object's behavior change is represented by its member classes, which share the same super class.

# Where to use & benefits

+ Need to control many states without using if-else or switch statements.
+ Use a class to represent a state, not a constant or something else.
+ Every state has to act in a similar manner.
+ Every state must be a subclass of the same super class.
+ Simplify and clarify the program.
